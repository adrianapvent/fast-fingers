## Description
Welcome to the Fast Fingers project!
An application that performs game-like functions to enhance typing skillset for levels. The initial idea behind the project, was to create a functional website to enhance our current typing skills, as we continue to build towards becoming web developers. The idea evolved to implement fun and rewarding concepts, such as racing against a clock and having a leaderboard, to entice all users to enjoy the tedious process of learning to type correctly and efficently. The application incorporates a retro theme and provides 'a blast from the past' feeling encouraging all ages to want to participate. The application incorporates higher level technologies such as Sequelize, Express, Node, bcrypt, and Heroku. Future development planning includes ideas for pseudorandominess, competing against other players, and suggestions for improvement.
